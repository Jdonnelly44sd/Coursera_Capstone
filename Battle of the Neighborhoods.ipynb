Composed of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the State of New York. The five boroughs\u2014Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island\u2014create a most diverse city with a long tradition of different ethnical restaurants.\n#### This final project explores the best locations for Sushi restaurants throughout the city of New York. Sushi restaurants have become extremely popular, as they offer a healthy alternative to regular American cuisine. That's why potentially the owner of a new Sushi restaurant can have great success and consistent profit. However, as with any business, opening a new restaurant requires serious considerations and is more complicated than it seems from the first glance. In particular, the location of the restaurant is one of the most important factors that will affect whether it will have success or a failure. So my project will attempt to answer the questions \u201cWhere should the investor open a Sushi Restaurant in Manhattan?\u201d and \u201cWhere should I go If I want great Sushi?\u201d\n",
